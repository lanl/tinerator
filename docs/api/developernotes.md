## Contributing

Best practices on contributing to this project, including formatting API docstrings, can be found in the [Contributing](../contributing.md) page.

### Code Formatting

Use the [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) code formatter
to ensure that code fits within a standardized style.

## Documentation Compilation

Documentation is found in the `tinerator/docs` folder and is written in Markdown.
The static site is generated by [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) using the
[Materials theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

### Required MkDocs Extensions

| Package         | Command                          |
|-----------------|----------------------------------|
| MathJax         | `pip install pymdown-extensions` |
| Codehilite      | `pip install pygments`           |
| Materials theme | `pip install mkdocs-material`    |

### API Generation

To generate API documents, you will need [`pydoc-markdown`](https://github.com/NiklasRosenstein/pydoc-markdown). This can be installed via:

```bash
pip install pydoc-markdown
```

Then, run:

    ./pydocmd_build.sh

in the `docs/api/` directory.


### Viewing the Site

After all requirements are resolved, run

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

to start the local server. Navigate your web browser to the
local server address (i.e., `http://127.0.0.1:8000`) to view.
MkDocs will automatically reload the static site upon any detected
file change within the `docs/` folder.

HTML files can be generated by using `mkdocs build`.

!!! note
    This manual process will eventually be phased out in support for TravisCI-based
    continuous deployment. Pull requests on this topic are welcome.
