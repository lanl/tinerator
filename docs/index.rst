=========================================
TINerator --- GIS Mesh Generation for FEM
=========================================

TINerator_ is a Python module for the rapid creation
of quality 2D and 3D unstructured meshes from GIS data sources.
It provides a set of GIS and mesh processing and manipulation
submodules that interface cleanly, along with robust visualization
methods, that allow for an end-to-end meshing workflow for 
FEM applications.

Mesh generation should be simple in Python. TINerator promotes
a human-readable, intuitive API framework that's easy to use
without sacrificing power.

A quality triangulation can be generated from a DEM in as 
few as two lines of code:

.. code:: python

   >>> import tinerator as tin
   >>> dem = tin.gis.load_raster("my_dem.tif")
   >>> tr = tin.meshing.triangulate(dem, min_edge_length=0.001)
   >>> tr.view()

And extruded into the subsurface (Z-direction) with just two more:

.. code:: python

   >>> layers = [("constant", 50., 2, 1)]
   >>> vol_mesh = tin.meshing.extrude_mesh(tr, layers)
   >>> vol_mesh.view()

Features
========

* Read/write GeoTIFFs, ESRI Shapefiles, and more - all common GIS formats
  are supported
* Built-in GIS operations like reprojecting, raster clipping, and resampling
* Adaptive mesh refinement using watershed delineation or any imported shapefile
* High-quality uniform and refined Delaunay triangulations using meshing kernels
  from `JIGSAW <http://www.github.com/jigsawpy>`_, PyGMSH, 
  MeshPy and more
* `ExodusII <https://github.com/seacas>`_ export supported, with full 
  support for side sets, node sets, and element sets.
* Advanced 2D and 3D visualization capabilities, including live 3D rendering
  within Jupyter notebook cells
* Much more
