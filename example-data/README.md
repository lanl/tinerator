# Example Data

## TODO: add metadata for each dataset

## Borden

The Borden dataset is a simple, low-resource DEM that forms the basis of the
Borden Benchmark test case.

The test case is based on the original field experiment and hydraulic parameters of
[Abdul and Gillham](https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-1694(89)90177-7), and is used by
[Kollet et al.](https://doi.org/10.1002/2016WR019191) for integrated hydrologic
model intercomparison.f
